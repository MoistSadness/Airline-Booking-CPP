The first data structure to learn in programming…

Most commonly and most widely used data structure in many applications…

Every beginner’s programming journey starts with solving the questions of Array. Being a programmer you might have surely used this data structure a lot in your application. This data structure is used in every possible situation where you need to collect the object in one place. From simple to complex software or web application array is mostly used to store and display the data dynamically at web pages. Let’s take one of the good examples of using an array in a real-world application…

We all must have used the online ticket booking system at least once. It might be for booking tickets for train or maybe bus or flights or movies or any other shows. If we want to book any seat, then it’s just a matter of clicking on a square and it will be booked. 


Have you ever wondered that the seat you book online on any system it’s a two-dimensional array? 

When you’re booking a seat it lies somewhere in a specific row and column. This can be represented by a two-dimensional array such as a seat[4][5]. So an array is applicable in all kinds of online booking systems. Hope you got the point and understood the real-world application of Array.
